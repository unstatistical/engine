A hobby project mainly for fun but also for school. Really, it is pointless, but my hope is it may grow into something more. Used as an opportunity to expand my programming horizons. Written in C, but useable in C++ environments. Currently supports Wayland and X11, with untested support for Win32. Feel free to join in the fun. This project is free, as in freedom.
